That's the question that my group and I have attempted to tackle over the semester. Prevailing data appears to show that Black and Hispanic New Yorkers experience higher rates of premature death due to chronic illnesses, childbirth, and violence. The goal of our project is to investigate these disparities and study how urban diversity affects many health outcomes for underrepresented communities across New York City's boroughs by pinpointing some of the factors, such as health care access, air quality, and race, which could affect healthcare outcomes. To accomplish this, we compiled public health data into a demonstrative visualization of health outcomes and health factors in New York City. Compiling these studies, weâ€™ll be left with a broad overview of how social factors affect health outcomes for everyday New Yorkers. Our hope is that a visualization similar to this one - lightweight, deployable, and built on free software - could be used to help inform future policy decisions. While the visualization is effective in some respects, it fails to provide useful correlative conclusions when not enough data is provided for a certain outcome or factor. "),
